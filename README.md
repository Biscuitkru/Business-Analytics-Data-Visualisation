## ST2187 Business Analytics Coursework
### Coursework for Tableau Utlisation

Your task will be to explore the dataset using Tableau's data visualisation tools in an effort to extract commercially-important insights in preparation for a presentation of your findings to senior management of the company.

The deliverable content will be in two parts:

•	A story (a collection of five dashboards) created in Tableau

•	An accompanying 1,500-word report, which describes the key insights from the story, including recommendations to senior management as a result of your discoveries.

Which visualisations and which variables you wish to explore will be depend on your judgement. The task is designed to simulate real-life situations when business analysts are faced with raw data and need to spend time exploring, or mining, the dataset hoping to discover interesting trends, patterns and relationships.

•	How clear your dashboards are, i.e. how effective your chosen visualisations are at showing the insights.

•	Creativity and imagination in your choice of visualisations.

•	The quality and professionalism of the story.
